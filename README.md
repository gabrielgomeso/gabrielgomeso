Hello stranger! 

My name is Gabriel, I'm a software developer in formation. At the time (jan/2021), I'm able to understand and/or write some code with:
- HTML and CSS;
- Javascript;
- ReactJS and a little bit of React Native;
- Ruby / Ruby on Rails;
- PHP;
- MySQL.

Goals:
- Become a well paid developer :D
- Travel the world

I'm a simple guy, don't need a lot of things hehe.
