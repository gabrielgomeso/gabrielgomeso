Hello stranger! I'm Gabriel.

I'm a programming student from Brazil trying to learn ReactJS and React Native. Later on I'll be studying GatsbyJS. I'm interested in studying mobile development with Swift or Kotlin, but didn't decided about it yet.
Iâ€™m currently learning CSS features like grid and flexbox. Also starting to learn ReactJS.
My major goal is to become a developer and travel around the world because of it.
