## Welcome to the Fantastic Factory of Silly Codes! :warning:
#### I'm Gabriel Gomes and I'll be your guide! :cop:
You see, I started coding when I was 15 in 2014, but I stopped it to go to law school! LAW SCHOOL! Can you believe it? Then, I decided that I didn't want to be a lawyer and got back to learning programming in 2020. Since then, I learned how to:
- Write semantic HTML;
- Create beautiful pages using CSS and SASS;
- Understand frameworks with VueJS, React and React Native;
- Build stuff with the amazing Ruby and its pal Ruby on Rails;
- Do some little things with PHP, MySQL, Bootstrap, etc.

Currently, I work at @quero-edu as a Web Development Intern, mainly using RoR to help people maintain the products "Quero Pago" and "Quero Bolsa"

:rocket: My main goal is to travel around the world while working with big projects and great people :smile:
