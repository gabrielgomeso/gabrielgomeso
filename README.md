## Welcome to the Fantastic Factory of Silly Codes! :warning:
#### I'm Gabriel Gomes and I'll be your guide! :cop:
You see, I started coding when I was 15 in 2014, but I stopped it to go to law school! LAW SCHOOL! Can you believe it? Then, I decided that I didn't want to be a lawyer and got back to learning programming in 2020. Since then, I've learned a few things like:
- HTML (or what they call "semantic HTML");
- CSS and it's nicer cousin SASS;
- JavaScript frameworks such as VueJS, ReactJS and React Native;
- The happy language Ruby and its pal Ruby on Rails;
- PHP, MySQL, Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS, Bulma, JQuery and probably a lot of other tech words. I may not be a expert but at least I know were to start learning if I need the thing lol

:rocket: My main goal is to travel around the world while working with big projects and great people :smile:
